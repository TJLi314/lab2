How to execute my file: 
I did my project in Java and have many .java files in the root directory to compile. To compile them, just run './compile.csh'. Or you can manually run the following:

'javac Main.java Scanner.java TransitionTable.java TokenType.java Token.java InterRep.java InterRepBlock.java Parser.java ParserResult.java Renaming.java Allocator.java'

This will create the 'Main.class' file needed to run my code. My '412alloc' script runs this.
